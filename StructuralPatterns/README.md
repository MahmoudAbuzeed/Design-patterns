# Design-patterns

<h3>Structural design patterns</h3>

These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition.
Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces.
Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

<h3>Examples</h3>

- Adapter
  Match interfaces of different classes

- Bridge
  Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation

- Composite
  A tree structure of simple and composite objects

- Decorator
  Add responsibilities to objects dynamically

- Facade
  A single class that represents an entire subsystem

- Flyweight
  A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing

- Private Class Data
  Restricts accessor/mutator access

- Proxy
  An object representing another object
